* Vanilla Birthsigns for OpenMW by Klorax
  /Vanilla Birthsigns for OpenMW by Klorax/ changes the behavior of the
  attribute enhancing birthsigns (the Lady, the Lover, and the Steed) to
  match that of original Morrowind.

  This is accomplished by replacing the constant magic effect with base
  attributes upon finishing character generation (i.e., when leaving the
  census office building). When this happens the player is notified. Thus you
  need to start a new game to use this addon.

  In original Morrowind these constant magic effects for attributes are
  treated as base attributes. This is inconsistent to any other constant magic
  effect (i.e., spell or enchant) for attributes. OpenMW removes this
  inconsistency, which is good IMHO, but this makes the original birthsigns
  behave differently (mostly less powerful), and this addon aims to fix this.

  This means that the provided endurance will now count for level up health.
  All relevant attributes (agility, endurance, personality, and speed) will
  now count towards skill level caps for governed skills. The attribute base
  values (through leveling) will not be able to get past 100.

* Installation
  Please follow the steps [[https://openmw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/modding/mod-install.html][here]].

* Technical Details
  This addon just adds one global script, one start script, and one global
  variable. Thus no birthsign, race, the character generation, or anything
  else has been modified, that could cause incompatibilities with other
  addons.

  The term "addon" is used as a synonym to "mod" and "plugin".

* Change Log
  Please see the [[https://github.com/klorax/openmw-vanilla_birthsigns/releases][releases]] for a detailed change log.

* Contributing
  If you find any bugs, then please create an issue in the GitHub repository
  (following the prefix convention below).
   
** Prefix Convention
   The prefix is used in the *Issue* header and *Commit* message like so:
   ~Prefix [#ISSUE]: Short message~. They are symmetric to ease the connection
   between *Issues*, *Commits*, and *Pull Requests*.

   | Prefix      | Issue                        | Commit                |
   |-------------+------------------------------+-----------------------|
   | Bug         | Bug fix request (bug report) | Bug fix and test done |
   | Doc         | Documentation request        | Documentation done    |
   | Edit        | Edit request                 | Edit done             |
   | Enhancement | Enhancement request          | Enhancement done      |
   | Feature     | Feature request              | Feature and test done |
   | Refactor    | Refactoring request          | Refactoring done      |
   | Skeleton    | Skeleton file request        | Skeleton file added   |

   Most of them should be self explanatory but here are some clarifications:

   - ~Edit~ is used for minor edits (e.g., rename, move, typo fix).
   - ~Enhancement~ is used for larger edits (e.g., adding helper methods, not
     enough to warrant a feature).
   - ~Skeleton~ is for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton_(computer_programming)][skeleton]] files which are just empty outlines of a Class
     to get the ball rolling.
