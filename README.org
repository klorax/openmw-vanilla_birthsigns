* Vanilla Birthsigns for OpenMW by Klorax
  /Vanilla Birthsigns for OpenMW by Klorax/ changes the behavior of the
  attribute enhancing birthsigns (the Lady, the Lover, and the Steed) to
  match that of original Morrowind.

  This is accomplished by replacing the constant magic effect with base
  attributes upon finishing character generation (i.e., when leaving the census
  office building).  When this happens the player is notified. Thus you need to
  start a new game to use this addon.

  In original Morrowind these constant magic effects for attributes are treated
  as base attributes.  This is inconsistent to any other constant magic effect
  (i.e., spell or enchant) for attributes.  OpenMW removes this inconsistency,
  which is good IMHO, but this makes the original birthsigns behave differently
  (mostly less powerful), and this addon aims to fix this.

  This means that the provided endurance will now count for level up health.
  All relevant attributes (agility, endurance, personality, and speed) will now
  count towards skill level caps for governed skills.  The attribute base
  values (through leveling) will not be able to get past 100.

* Installation
  Please follow the steps [[https://openmw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/modding/mod-install.html][here]].

* Technical Details
  This addon just adds one global script, one start script, and one global
  variable.  Thus no birthsign, race, the character generation, or anything
  else has been modified, that could cause incompatibilities with other addons.

  The term "addon" is used as a synonym to "mod" and "plugin".

  Please see the [[https://github.com/klorax/openmw-vanilla_birthsigns/releases][releases]] for a detailed change log.

* Contributing
  If you find any bugs, then please create an issue in the GitHub repository
  (following the prefix convention below).
   
** Prefix Convention
   The prefix is used in the *Issue* header: ~PREFIX: Short message~, and the
   *Commit* message: ~PREFIX [#ISSUE]: Short message~.  They are symmetric to
   ease the workflow between *Issues*, *Commits*, and *Pull Requests*.

   | Prefix      | Issue                        | Commit                |
   |-------------+------------------------------+-----------------------|
   | Bug         | Bug fix request (bug report) | Bug fix and test done |
   | Doc         | Documentation request        | Documentation done    |
   | Edit        | Edit request                 | Edit done             |
   | Enhancement | Enhancement request          | Enhancement done      |
   | Feature     | Feature request              | Feature and test done |
   | Refactor    | Refactoring request          | Refactoring done      |
   | Skeleton    | Skeleton file request        | Skeleton file added   |

   Most of them should be self explanatory but here are some clarifications:

   - ~Edit~ is used for minor edits (e.g., rename, move, typo fix).
   - ~Enhancement~ is used for larger edits (e.g., adding helper methods, not
     enough to warrant a feature).
   - ~Skeleton~ is for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton_(computer_programming)][skeleton]] files which are just empty outlines of a Class
     to get the ball rolling.
